This is SnackSndfileExt extension for the snack2.2 framework. Its main
purpose is to add reading capabilities for all the formats supported
by libsndfile library to snack2.2 and programs based on it (e.g.:
wavesurfer, transcriber, ...).

This extension was entirily written during my spare time. I will not
ask you for money, but to keep this code and its modifications free: I
will evaluate to release this code under any license that will give to
you and any other permission to freely distribute, modify and use this
software for any purposes (e.g.: the code is currently released under
any version of the LGPL of your choice). I will not evaluate any
license that will allow you to distribute modified version of this
code without giving to others the same permissions (e.g.: I will not
evaluate BSD-like licenses).

The extension is still young and probably plenty of BUGS. BUG reports,
patches and suggestions are welcome.
